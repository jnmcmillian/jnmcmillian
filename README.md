Hello! My name is Julianne McMillian, I am a student currently attending Southern New Hampshire University in the field of Computer Programming (CERT), graduating in Dec. 2023. I am proficient in the languages of Python, Java, and C++, and will soon be persuing a B.S. Computer Programming degree.

I enjoy challenging projects that demand outside-the-box thinking, and collaborating on open source projects. From beginning my time at SNHU, I have developed a deep passion to create programs that provide clear and precise instruction to both the developer and its intended audience. While striving for a higher education, I conjunctly expand on skills that I can use in my career, such as JavaScript, HTML, and SQL. The aim is to advance in Data Science & Analysis using Python, Full Stack Development, and Software Engineering.
