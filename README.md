😃Hello! My name is Julianne McMillian, I am a student currently attending Southern New Hampshire University (SNHU) in the field of Computer Programming (CERT), graduating in 12/2023. I am proficient in the languages of Python, Java, and C++, and will soon be persuing a B.S. in Computer Programming.

🌱I enjoy challenging projects that demand outside-the-box thinking, and collaborating on open source projects. From beginning my time at SNHU, I have developed a deep passion to create programs that provide clear and precise instruction to both the developer and its intended audience. While striving for a higher education, I conjunctly expand on skills that I can use in my career, such as JavaScript, HTML, and SQL. The aim is to advance in Data Science & Analysis using Python, Full Stack Development, and Software Engineering. 

🎭In my free time, I love cooking, going for hikes, and spending time with family. My hobbies include listening to and making music, painting, astronomy, and simply learning new things. In fact, it makes me pretty good at trivia! Some of my ambitions in life are to work hard so I can take care of my family, travel the world, and experience everything life has to offer!
